<h2 id="First_Point_Header">Personal Information</h2>
<p>Joshua Misener<br />
Student Number: s3799261<br />
jmisener@outlook.com <br />
Australian by birth, Higher School Certificate, speaks English, I spend a lot of time training and honing my martial arts.</p>

<h2 id="Second_Point_Header">Interest in IT</h2>
<p>My interest in IT stems from when I played video games as a child; I chose to come to RMIT because it is a well regarded University with a good online program. 
I expect to learn the basic fundamentals of IT that can be used to segway into something greater later on.</p>

<ul>
<li>A Cloud Architect is a specialist who is responsible for overseeing a company's cloud program. This includes cloud creation, cloud design, management and monitoring. Cloud architects basically oversee the creation and smooth running of a cloud system.</li>
<li>This position is appealing to me because of multiple factors, firstly the ability to lead a team on a sophisticated project, good pay and flexible hours.</li>
<li>The qualifications necessary for this position are way above my own, requiring knowledge of AWS cloud solutions, previous experience and a TOGAF certification.</li>
<li>The skills, experience and or qualifications that I currently hold in regards to this field are almost zero.</li>
<li>From here, I will finish a bachelor of information technology and then continue into specialist study, and hopefully be able to secure an internship along the way.</li>
</ul>
